                        <p>
                            I currently teach grades K-12, and I designed the technology courses at Independence Middle School and Grayson County High Schools' career and technical center.
                        </p>
                            My high school classes are engineering design courses that span mechanics, electronics, CAD drawing, graphic design, parts fabrication, prototyping, product testing, and iterative design. Through project based learning, I teach my students the technical skills that prepare them for their capstone project- a robot that has both driver-controlled and self-driving modes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The students built their robots primarily using parts from the REV Robotics Education Kit. Students were tasked with creating a robot able to complete game objectives derived from the First Tech Challenge 2020 - 2021 season game. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the project milestones was for students to add LEDs to their robots with a uniquely identifiable light pattern. For this project, we sourced and purchased LEDs, Arduino Nanos, and other pieces of circuitry.  The lights were programmed in C. Students were able to code different light patterns and colors and attach the system to their robots. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Students were also able to further explore their artistic side as they designed and built  protective panels for their robots. The students used Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Capture to design their panels, and included their robotsâ€™ names and some type of emblem in the design. The students employed the Engineering Design Process as they iterated through plywood prototypes before investing in acrylic parts. Ultimately, students made four prototypes, which were all created using a Universal Laser Systems laser cutter. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the spring semester, we loosely followed the Agile methodology to manage the development process, and we concluded the semester with a Retrospective Ceremony. We primarily discussed the robots, but I also collected feedback on the course itself. The students were pleased about how substantial the robots were and how much they learned. They reported that it changed their daily thinking, causing them to think about coding applications in their everyday lives. They attributed the class with teaching them to think better on their feet, improving their logical thinking skills, and making them better at working as a team.

                        <h3 class="lead">An engineer and educator passionate about EdTech and student success</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am a licensed educator with an endorsement in engineering with K-12 teaching experience. I have degrees in civil engineering and molecular biology, and I also studied at the Violin Making School of America. In addition to making physical products, I enjoy making music.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I lead my students by enabling their creative freedom as they tackle new and challenging technical projects. My process begins with placing students at an intersection of engineering, design, music, and art. Then, I help them acquire technical skills and manage their progress as they create something exciting. My ultimate goal is to help students increase their self-confidence and self-esteem while maintaining an organized environment for productive experiences. I nurture abundant mindsets in my classroom to promote values of equity, empathy, and perseverance.
